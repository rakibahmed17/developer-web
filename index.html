          What is meant by paragraph writing? Paragraph writing is a process of
          writing a self-contained unit on a particular idea or topic. A
          paragraph is a group of sentences making absolute sense which has a
          topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a conclusion statement.

            Paragraphs are distinct blocks of text which section out a larger
            piece of writing—stories, novels, articles, creative writing or
            professional writing pieces—making it easier to read and understand.
            Good paragraphs are a handy writing skill for many forms of
            literature, and good writers can greatly enhance the readability of
            their news, essays, or fiction writing when constructed properly.
